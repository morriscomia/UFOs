# UFOs

## Overview
The goal is to show the data as a table and provide the option to filter sightings depending on chosen criteria given a JavaScript file containing UFO sighting information. 


## Summary
Using the data saved in the JavaScript array, create a table that can be shown as a website. Added a date filter to make the website more dynamic and responsive to user input. The entire page was then displayed in an ascetically appealing manner using Bootcamp templates.

## Challenge Overview
With the date filter in place, having additional conditions to filter for would be more beneficial. City, state, nation, and shape are the four new categories. The ability to filter UFO encounters more selectively will aid in providing more in-depth analysis.

## Challenge Summary
Four more filters for the table holding the data were built by adding to the initial script for the homepage. Bootstrap was used to personalise the page, and the grid structure that Bootstrap employs enables for a responsive and well-organized webpage. The option to search comments for certain phrases might be implemented as a future feature. The ability to search for sightings that reported a "red" hue would be beneficial.
